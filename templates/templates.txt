Templates:

Templates have a certain format to follow

As of now each object can have properties of type:
    INT(start,end)      - an integer in the range start (inc.) to end (exc.)
    FLT(start,end)      - an floating-point in the range start (inc.) to end (exc.)
    STR(str1,str2,...)  - a string from the strings given
    BLN                 - a boolean (true or false)
    UID                 - A UUID v6 string
    filename.txt        - A wordlist file in the /wordlist directory

The data generator will parse this template, and generate values
given these parameters. 

Note this is a hard configuration. 
Note that there are no spaces in properties.
For example, don't do this: INT(5 , 7)
I will fix this soon. Should be an easy fix. Just tired rn.

Will also add nested object functionality soon.
For a good example: Look at part.json
